    - **Visualizations**
      - Line plots and bar charts for pedestrian activity patterns
      - Proper axis formatting to display complete numbers (no scientific notation)

## Dataset

The analysis uses the **Brooklyn Bridge Automated Pedestrian Counts Demonstration Project** dataset provided by the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT).  
Dataset link: [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Brooklyn-Bridge-Automated-Pedestrian-Counts-Demonstration-Project/6fi9-q3ta)

## Instructions

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in any Python environment (Jupyter, Colab, VSCode, etc.).
2. Run the cells sequentially to see all calculations, analysis, and visualizations.
3. All plots are formatted to display complete numbers and readable labels.
4. Sections include:
    - Weekday analysis
    - Weather impact analysis
    - Time-of-day pedestrian patterns
